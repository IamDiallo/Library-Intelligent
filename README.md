<h1>Library Intelligente</h1>
This project was built for a University Assignment, in the project we implemented the Collaborative filtring Algorithm to recommend books based on the profile and transaction
history of the customers.

    <h3>1.Books Recommendation Based on the Profile:</h3>   
      We recommend books base on many criterias of your profile that you can choose while signing.
   <h3>1.Books Recommendation Based on the Transactions:</h3>   
     Using the item-based collaborative filtring we were able to recommend you books that you may be interested to buy
    <h3>Filtring Fonctionnalities</h3>  
       Just like in a amazon website you can filter books that was recommended to you.
    <h2>All the books used to test the Algorithm were from Google Books API</h2>  
       we used over 2000 books, 300 users and 80000 transaction to train and test the algorithm.
 <h2>The project was documented using doxygen there is a html and pdf format of the documentation available</h2>
